Sally's Resume with React App

Requirements
Put your code in an index.html and create a GitHub repository to share it.
Make an App component which will render the full resum√©.
Use semantic HTML throughout the page, so, a header, main, section and address.
Include the contact information section with the Name, Email address, Phone number, and a picture. Feel free to choose one or use this image of Ilana from Broad City as a stand-in for Sally.
Include a section for Sally's education.
There should be a section for Sally's employment history with at least 2 entries, each with the company name, job title, dates of employment and a short description.
As a stretch, write some responsive, mobile-first CSS styles for this application to keep practicing those CSS skills. We don't want to go rusty with CSS.
A second stretch would be to use a prop to control the student's name that's being rendered.
